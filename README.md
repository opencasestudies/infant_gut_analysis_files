# infant_gut_analysis

## Introduction

This repository is the companion repository to the Bio-OCS Version Control case study. This is meant to serve an educational purpose, while mimicking a repository for a scientific analysis. These are real data, introduced by Wang et al.

## Organization

This repo is organized as follows:

- 01_pull_study_data.R: script to read in data from "raw_data/Table S1.xlsx" and create a single data table in "processed_data/sample_metadata.rda"
- 02_wrangle_data.R: script to wrangle data from "processed_data/sample_metadata.Rda" to fix mistakes, remove invalid observations, and make data easier to work with, creates "processed_data/clean_sample_metadata.Rda"
- raw_data: 
  - Table S1.xlsx: Supplementary information from [Wang et al.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19490976.2021.1911571?scroll=top&needAccess=true#abstract), included as part of a [.zip file](https://www.tandfonline.com/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.1080%2F19490976.2021.1911571&file=kgmi_a_1911571_sm8722.zip)
- processed_data: 
  - sample_metadata.rda: table with data about samples from each original study included in the meta-analysis of Wang et al., generated in "01_pull_study_data.R"
  - clean_sample_metadata.rda: table with cleaned data about samples from each original study, generated in "02_wrangle_data.R"
